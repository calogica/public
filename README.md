This is a not very well organized collection of Python/R/Julia scripts, Jupyter notebooks etc I thought were worth sharing.

The **Tableau Redshift-to-Snowflake converter** has moved to the calogica organization, in its own [repo](https://github.com/calogica/tableau-redshift-snowflake-converter).

You can find my **dbt-starter** [repo](https://github.com/calogica/dbt_starter) there as well.
